## Description
 
What is the most valuable thing that linguistics can teach you that will help you become a better language learner? In my experience it was understanding the distinction between phonemes and speech sounds and having a good idea of what different subfields of linguistics are and what they do.<br>
In this video I talk about those two topics that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, go well hand in hand, and I also touch upon a common misconception that I came across quite a lot when talking to other language learners.
