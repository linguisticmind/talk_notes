## Description
 
Linguistic Mind is a channel for language learners where I share resources, tools and tutorials to help you acheive your language learning goals.<br>
In this video I talk about the types of content I'm planning to make on this channel and its transition from an earlier version where I dabbled in making random videos about random topics.
