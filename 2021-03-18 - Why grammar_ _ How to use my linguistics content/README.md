## Description
 
How can grammar knowledge help a language learner acheive their goals? Knowing all the rules certainly won't do the trick. It's by treating language theory as a tool that one can help their immersion, which in turn will translate into genuine knowledge of the target language.<br>
In this video I talk about how one should think about grammar and language theory in general, and how to use the language theory-related content that I publish on this channel.
