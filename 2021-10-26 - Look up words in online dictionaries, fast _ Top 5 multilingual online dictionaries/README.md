## Description
 
Having a dictionary at your fingertips is a convenient thing for any language learner. Being able to look up words quickly saves your time and energy when learning a language.<br>
In this video I show a method of setting up your browser in a way that will allow you to find words in almost any online dictionary out there in just a few keystrokes.<br>
In the second part of the video I talk about several multilingual online dictionaries that have been very useful to me, and that can be of huge help to learners of many different languages.<br>
I also share some language learning methodology and tech tips along the way.

## Notes
 
Notes on importing 'bookmarks.html':
 
If you happen to be using the 'Default Bookmark Folder' add-on (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/default-bookmark-folder/), it will interfere with importing bookmarks from an HTML file. If that add-on is enabled, all of the imported bookmarks will end up in your default folder that is set in the add-on. (It will also interfere with copying and pasting bookmarks in the Library window in the exact same fashion.)<br>
Disable the add-on before importing the bookmarks, and re-enable it when you're done.
