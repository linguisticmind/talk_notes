## Description
 
"How to say this in the language I'm learning?" is not a useful question to ask. Each language provides different means to express ideas. So if you don't know how a certain idea is expressed in a language, the best thing to do is to keep immersing until you come across a way of expressing that idea in your target language.<br>
I talk about a realization that I had about the mindset of a language learner, and share a bit of my language learning story.
