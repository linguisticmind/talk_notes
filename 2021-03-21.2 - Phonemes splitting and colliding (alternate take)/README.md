## Description
 
If phonemes are the smallest units of the spoken language, what happens when the system shifts, and in certain cases phonemes become indistinguishable from one another? Or what if in cases where there was no distinction before, one suddenly starts to arise? Neutralization and phonemicization.<br>
This video is an alternate take of the explanation of these phenomena from the video called 'The most important lesson of linguistics (and The Big Picture)'.
