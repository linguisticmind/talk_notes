## Description
 
If immersion is the red pill, knowing the theory is seeing the Matrix. But, in order to see the Matrix you have to take the red pill first.<br>
In order to allow your brain to acquire a language, you have to give it the right input. Immersion is that input. And theory is a tool to help you undestand your immersion better.
