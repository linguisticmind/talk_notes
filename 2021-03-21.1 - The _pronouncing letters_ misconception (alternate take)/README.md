## Description
 
What sense does it make to talk about "pronouncing letters" when language, spoken at its core, once had no letters to pronounce?

If "pronouncing letters" is a bad way of thinking about it, what is the right way?<br>
This video is an alternate take of the explanation of the "pronouncing letters" misconception from the video called 'The most important lesson of linguistics (and The Big Picture)'.
